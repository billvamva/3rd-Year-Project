# 3rd-Year-Project
My 3rd Year EEE project using machine learning to optimize an SOA

My abstract
This paper studies particle swarm optimization as a method of
producing an electronic drive signal to turn on a semiconductor amplifier,
which will act as an ultra-fast switch for data transfer based on
existing research. Improvements in the algorithm used will be
made by experimenting with changing the sampling-rate, the shell
used to formulate the minimum and maximum of the signal and the
transfer function of the equivalent circuit used to emulate the SOA.
The experimental setup with also be tampered with by implementing
the use of cascaded SOAs and observing how the gain profile of
the system varies while also employing the FPGA as an 8-bit DAC to
provide the control signal instead of an arbitrary waveform generator
that was used in the main research.
