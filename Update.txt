Initial Goals:

Change dimensions of problem

Experiment using set number of iterations and particles

Plot number of dimension with rising time, settling time and overshoot

Shift all dimensions to 240 points using upsampling.


Meeting 04/12/2020:

- Tried to change getSOAoutput methods in optimization.py and distort_tf.py
- Managed to upsample U but then data was saved in 240 point folder only
- Issue with U: Turns from numpy array to list in one of the last iterations
- Should U and T have the same number of points? Value Error
- path_to_pso_data should be changed?
- what is m and K? why is m a different variable if it is equal to num_points?
- line 894: Index is bool but is given as None?
- method runPSOalgorithm: why do we initialize copies? Answer: So that other particles get different results that are not biased.
FOLLOWUP:
- Why do we reset for next PSO run if they are copied from self at the beginning? Only curr_iter should be reset
- rt_st_os analysis is a matrix not a list: rows are different values and columns are the iterations.
- example data: data_df = pd.dataframe(data) -> data_df.to_csv(path)
- run PSO algorithm modifies path_to_pso_data to include rep in line 939
- Where is path_to_pso_data modified that when number of points change it gets affected?
Answer: Possibly object is being modified after each iteration? Would not explain why it does not allow after each repetition.
- path_to_pso_data = depends on self.directory but gets altered somewhere?

- why is path_to_embedded_signal None?
- look line 847 used to find Best fitness line.

- Series of code being run: Class is initiliased in optimization using run_test (used for threading), Constructor creates init values and path etc, runPSO algorithm.

- Important question: Why is U reshaped from (239,) to (239,1)
- Find out what X0 is.
- How is cost calculated exactly?

- NV everything is poloted in _evaluateParticlePositions.
- Cost is essentially MSE?
- Is there somewhere where the path is changed if the points in U and T are changed?

- What do I need to change except for SOA output and t? g line 955, 990 and 1009; self.x line 169 ; curr_outputs; look x-value line 1030--> anything using self.m??
- Ask about 813: How is this used?
- Issue either with m or with path_to_pso_data
